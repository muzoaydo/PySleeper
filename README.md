# PySleeper
This is a windows application that i wrote to use when i fall asleep while i am watching something on my PC. As you can see it has three functions, a description and a text box. 
You simply just write the minutes in the text box and choose to put the computer to sleep or shutdown mode. And also the last button is for canceling the shutdown.

IMPORTANT!
There is a path at the beggining of the program so you should set it before launch or you will get an error. Also you can just put the BG image in the local folder and instead of
giving in the path name to the function below you can just type "bg.jpg".
