# PySleeper
This is a windows application that i wrote to use when i fall asleep while i am watching something on my PC. As you can see it has three functions, a description and a text box. 
You simply just write the minutes in the text box and choose to put the computer to sleep or shutdown mode. And also the last button is for canceling the shutdown.
