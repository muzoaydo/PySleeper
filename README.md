# PySleeper
This is a windows application that i wrote to use when i fall asleep while i am watching something on my PC. As you can see it has three functions, a description and a text box.

You simply just write the minutes in the text box and choose to put the computer to sleep or shutdown mode. And also you can cancell the shutdown.

Update: I have added a sleep in 45 min button so i don't have to type in the minutes every time.

As i have said this app is for my personal use but also it is my very first program. So that is why i share this on my GitHub :)
